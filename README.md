My very first C++ program I wrote back in school somewhere around 2002.
Please __don't run it as root__ as it will add a passwordless root account on your
system! You have been warned!
It puts tcsh as the shell for the new root user since this was way back when
I run SuSE and they had tcsh as default (I think).
